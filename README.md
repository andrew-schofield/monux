## Usage

- [Create a new OAuth client](https://developers.monzo.com/apps/home) on the Monzo developer site. The name, logo and description can be anything you like but...
- The `Redirect URLs` must be `monux://auth/` for the application to collect the auth tokens correctly and `Confidentiality` must to set to `Confidential`.
- Copy the `Client ID` and `Client secret` over to the input fields when launching.
- Follow instructions and follow standard Monzo auth flow.
